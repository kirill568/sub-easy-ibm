<h3>
    <a id="Explanation" name="Explanation">Explanation</a>
</h3>
<p>
    To fully understand the purpose of a business you must know <b>who</b> the business interacts with; that is, who puts
    demands on it, or is interested in its output. The different types of "interactors" are represented as <b>business
    actors</b><i>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    The term actor means the role someone, or something plays while interacting with the business. The following types of
    business users are examples of potential business actors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customers
    </li>
    <li>
        Suppliers
    </li>
    <li>
        Partners
    </li>
    <li>
        Potential customers (the "market place")
    </li>
    <li>
        Local authorities
    </li>
    <li>
        Colleagues in parts of the business not modeled.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Hence, an actor normally corresponds to a human user. However, there are situations where, for instance, an information
    system plays the role of an actor. If your bank's on-line services are so good that your business can manage most of
    its bank transactions from a PC on your own premises, your use cases interacting with the "money supplier" actor, the
    bank, will in fact interact with an information system.
</p>
<p>
    An actor represents a particular type of business user rather than a real physical user. Several physical users of a
    business can play the same role in relation to it; that is, they act as instances of one and the same actor. Also, the
    same user can act as several different actors. This means that one and the same person can embody instances of
    different actors.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="How to Name Business Actors" name="How to Name Business Actors">How to Name Business Actors</a>
</h3>
<p>
    A business actor should be given a name that reflects its role towards the business. The name should be applicable to
    any person-or any information system-playing the role.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Business Actor Characteristics" name="Business Actor Characteristics">Business Actor Characteristics</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The characteristics of a business actor should cover the following topics:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prior knowledge and experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Social and physical environment.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Job, tasks, and requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cognitive characteristics.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This information is useful to define the business use cases in a way that is meaningful to the business actor. It is
    only relevant for "human" business actors.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics">Checklist for Good Business Actors</a>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        All actors are found. Everything in the business environment interactions-both human and mechanical-is modeled with
        actors. You cannot be sure of finding every actor until you have found and described every use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each human actor expresses a role, not a specific person. You should be able to name at least two persons that can
        play the role of each actor. If you can't, you may have modeled a person, not a role. Of course, there are
        situations in which you can find only one person who can play a role.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each actor models something outside the business.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each actor is involved with at least one use case. If an actor does not interact with at least one use case, you
        should remove it.
    </li>
    <li>
        A specific actor does not interact with the business in several completely different ways. If an actor interacts in
        several completely different ways, you have probably assigned several roles to one actor. In that case, you should
        split the actor into several actors, each representing a different role.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each actor has an explanatory name and description. An actor's name should represent the role it plays in relation
        to the business. The name must be understandable to people outside the business-modeling team.
    </li>
