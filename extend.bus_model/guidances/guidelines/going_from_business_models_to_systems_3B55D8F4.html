<p>
    The approach to business modeling presented in the Rational Unified Process includes a concise and straightforward way
    to generate requirements for supporting business tools or systems. A good understanding of business processes is
    important for building the right systems. Even more value is added if you use people's roles and responsibilities, as
    well as definitions of what "things" are handled by the business as a basis for building the system. It's from this
    more internal view of the business, captured in a business analysis model, that you can see the tightest link to what
    the models of the system needs to look like.

</h3>
<p>
    From an architectural perspective, having business models in place is particularly useful if your intent is to build
    one of the following kinds of systems:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customized systems for one or more companies in a particular type of industry, such as banks and insurance
        companies.
    </li>
    <li>
        A family of applications for the open market, such as order handling systems, billing systems, and air-traffic
        control systems.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The business models give input to the use-case view and the logical view as presented in the analysis model. You can
    also find key mechanisms at the analysis level, which are referred to as analysis mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
    The following should be considered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For each business use case that will be supported by the system, identify a subsystem in the analysis model. This
        subsystem is in the application layer and is considered a first prototype iteration. For example, if you have an
        Order process and a Billing process in your business use-case model, identify an Order subsystem and a Billing
        subsystem in the application layer of your analysis model. You may argue that Order and Billing are separate
        systems. Well, that's a matter of scope. If <span         style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">you're</span>
        considering all of your business tools as one system with several applications that share architecture, Order and
        Billing would be application subsystems. If your scope is to build an Order Management application only, then Order
        Management would be your system and the recommendation above would not make sense. It only makes sense if your
        scope is such that you consider all business tools in your organization as one system.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each business worker supported by the system, identify use cases that represent what is to be automated.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each business entity supported by the system, identify entity classes in the analysis model. Some of these are
        candidates for being considered as key mechanisms, the component entities, in the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        For clusters of business entities-a group of business entities that are used solely within one business use case or
        a group of otherwise closely related business entities-create a subsystem in the business specific layer.
    </li>
</ul>

    For each business worker, identify a candidate system actor. For each business use case the business worker
    participates in, create a candidate system use case.
</p>
<p>
    To identify information-system use cases, begin with the business workers in the business analysis model.
</p>
<p>
    For each business worker, perform the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decide if the business worker will be a person that will use the information system.
    </li>
    <li>
        If so, identify an actor for the business worker in the information system's use-case model. Start by creating an
        actor with the same name as the business worker.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat these steps for all business workers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each business use case realization, perform the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify those sequences of steps that are initiated by a system actor (as identified in the previous steps).
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a system use case for each sequence of steps. Start by using the initiating step name (operation name) as
        the use case name.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the system use case meets all the criteria for a system use case (provides meaningful value to the
        actor and so on). Merge or further divide system use cases as appropriate.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that this is just a starting point for the system's use-case model. As the requirements from the system's
    perspective are better understood, these initial system actors and use cases will be refactored as needed.

<p>
    If you are aiming at building a system that completely automates a set of business processes-which is the case if you
    are building an e-commerce application-for example, it's no longer the business worker who will become the system
    actor. Instead, it's the business actor who will directly communicate with the system and act as a system actor.
</p>
<p>
    You are, in effect, changing the way business is performed when building an application of this kind. Responsibilities
    of the business worker will be moved to the business actor.
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:

<p class="example">
    When building an e-commerce site for a bank, you will be modifying the way the process is realized.

    A business entity to be managed by an information system will correspond to an entity in the analysis model of the

    entities in the information-system model. Several business workers can access a business entity. Consequently, the

</h3>
<p>
    Business events identify important occurrences or changes of state in the business. They are used to decouple business
    use cases and send notifications or triggers about the occurrence or change in state. As such, they are an excellent
    source for business process automation, to reduce interactions between business workers and speed up business use
    cases. Automating business events allows for the rapid propagation of important information throughout the business,
    without burdening business workers with this responsibility.
</p>
<h5>
    Example:
</h5>
<p class="example">
    For example, all units involved in a military operation, may need to be notified immediately in the event of a
    strategic vantage point being claimed by friendly (or hostile) forces. Without automation, this business may be
    implemented by broadcasting a codeword (such as <b>Top Hat</b>) on a specific radio frequency. It would be left up to
    all receivers of the codeword to take the necessary action (such as proceeding into the next phase of battle).
    Automating this business event would allow for more efficient notification of the event, as well as possibly automating
    the different responses to the event as well.

<p>
    How should you interpret a link between workers in the business model? You must find out how the information systems
    can support the communicating workers. An information system can eliminate the need to transport information between
    workers by making the information available in the information system.

    Planning</a>
</h3>
<p>
    If you intend to use the business analysis model for resource planning or as a basis for simulation, you will need to
    update it to reflect what types of resources are used. You need to modify it so that each business worker and business
    entity is implemented by only one type of resource. If your aim is to re-engineer the business process, in the first
    iteration of your business analysis model, you should not consider resources. Doing so tends to make you focus on the
    already existing solutions, rather than on identifying problems that can be solved with new kinds of solutions. Here's
    an example of a procedure to consider:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In a first iteration of the business analysis model, work without considering the resources or the systems that
        will be used to implement the business.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss what can be automated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss how automation can change the business process and start sketching out a system use-case model and system
        requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a second iteration to the business analysis model, update it to reflect resources used and what is to be
        automated. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Some business workers will be tagged as automated workers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some business workers will be split into two-one automated, the other one not.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parts of two business workers may be partitioned out to a new automated worker.
            </li>
