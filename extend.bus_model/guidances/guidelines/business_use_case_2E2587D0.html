    <a id="XE_business_use_case__categories_of" name="XE_business_use_case__categories_of"></a>The processes of a business
    are defined as a number of different business use cases, each of which represents a specific workflow in the business.
    A business use case defines what should happen in the business when it is performed; it describes the performance of a
    sequence of actions that produces a valuable result to a particular business actor. A business process either generates
    value for the business or mitigates costs to the business.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/bucm1.gif" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext" align="center">
    A passenger can either travel individually or with a group. When traveling with a group, a passenger is accompanied by
    a tour guide.
</p>
<p>
    A business use case describes "a sequence of actions performed in a business that produces a result of observable value
    to an individual actor of the business". Hence, from an individual actor's perspective, a business use case defines the
    complete workflow that produces the desired results. This is similar to what is generally called a "business process",
    but "a business use case" has a much more precise definition.
</p>
<p>
    The definition of the business use case concept contains a number of keywords, which are essential to understanding
    what a business use case is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Business use case instance - the definition above is really describing a specific business workflow; that is, an
        instance. In reality, there are a great number of possible workflows, many of them very similar.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        To make the use-case model understandable, similar workflows are grouped together into a business use case-a
        "class" in terms of the object model. To identify and describe a business use case means to identify and describe
        the class-like business use case, not the individual use case instances. Thus a business use case will define
        decision points and alternative flows; which path is taken will depend on the state of the business, business
        events,&nbsp;and input from the business actor.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        An individual actor - The actor is probably the real key to finding the correct business use case. Starting with
        individual actors-or really instances of actors-helps avoid business use cases that are too large or complex.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        When determining suitable actors, first try to name at least two or three different people who could perform as the
        actor in question, then critically evaluate the support each individual requires. For example, suppose you
        initially identify an actor called "customer". Later, as you look deeper into the support each individual customer
        requires, you might find three rather different customers: the normal "user" of the product, the "purchaser" and
        the "evaluator", who are competent to compare the product with its competitors. Each of these may require a
        separate business use case because they represent different roles that can be played in the business.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        A result of observable value - This expression is very important in determining the correct extent of a business
        use case, which should be neither too small nor too big. Stating that the business use case should give a result of
        observable value, that is, both perceived and measurable, helps you to find a complete flow, and avoid business use
        cases that are too small.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        A good business use case helps an actor perform a task that has an identifiable value. It may be possible to put a
        price on a successfully performed business use case. A too-small business use case will have a limited scope, thus
        also little re-engineering potential.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        In a business - The words "actions performed in a business", means both that the business provides the business use
        case to the actor, and that the business use case only covers what is actually done within the business. Supporting
        work done elsewhere is not included.
    </li>
    <li>
        Action - The actions are invoked either on request from an actor to the business or at a certain point in time.
        Actions include internal tasks and decisions, as well as requests to either the invoked actor or other actors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Business use cases&nbsp;specify the interactions between the subject business and its (external) business actors,
    <em>and the effect that they have on the business</em> - the performance of a business use case may change the state of
    the business (and thus may change the way the business responds to future events or interactions), and the business use
    case must specify these state changes.
</p>
<p>
    What the business directly and explicitly provides to its environment are <em>services</em> (the business from this
    perspective is simply the top level Business System and should therefore encapsulate its resources and provide
    well-defined services to its environment -&nbsp;see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_system_4B3288B3.html" guid="5.503233494422666E-306">Guideline:
    Business System</a>), and the interaction between the Business Actor and the business, as described in the Business Use
    Case, will take place through the invocation of one or more of those services. Note that for new business development
    (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_creation_ABCA16F6.html" guid="_x8e2CdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business creation</a>, for example), or when changing the business,&nbsp;Business Use
    Cases are one way of identifying services that the business must support.
</p>
<p>
    The collected set of business use cases constitute all the possible ways of using the business. See also <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html" guid="3.9905535055726305E-306">Guideline: Business Use-Case Model</a>.

</h3>
<p>
    In a use-case driven business modeling project, you develop two views of the business.
</p>
<p>
    The business use case itself presents an external view of the business, which defines <b>what</b> is essential to
    perform for the business to deliver the desired results to the actor. It also defines <b>what</b> interaction (the
    business actor-business input-response sequence)&nbsp;the business should have with the actors when the business use
    case is executed. Such a view must be developed when you are deciding and agreeing on what should be done in each
    business use case. A collection of business use cases gives an overview of the business that is very useful for
    informing employees of what different parts of the business are doing, and what results are expected. A business use
    case description does this without reference to the actual internal structure of the business. Note that the business
    use case should also describe any state changes in the business that occur when it is executed, as well as any
    significant business events raised or received. The business use case does not prescribe how business state is to be
    established and maintained internally, or how business events are to be communicated internally - but it does specify
    <strong>what</strong> the state changes are and <strong>what</strong> the significant business events are, to be able
    to present a complete view of required business behavior.
</p>
<p>
    A business use-case realization, on the other hand, gives an internal view of the business use case, which defines
    <b>how</b> the work should be organized and performed in order to achieve the same desired results. A realization
    encompasses the business workers and business entities that are involved in the execution of a business use case and
    the relationships between them that are required to do the job. Such views must be developed to decide and agree on how
    the work in each business use case must be organized to achieve the desired results. The Business Designer ensures that
    there are consistent mappings between the specification (the <strong>what</strong>), in the business use case, and the
    realization (the <strong>how</strong>), in the business use-case realization, for the business state changes and
    business events, to achieve the desired behavior across <em>all</em> business use cases.
</p>
<p>
    Both views of the business use case are primarily intended for people within the business - the external view for
    people who work outside the business use case, the internal view for people who work inside the business use case.
</p>

    Instances of Business Use Cases</a>
</h3>
<p>
    As a business operates, you will find that you can identify an almost unlimited number of separate workflows. A
    use-case instance is simply a specific workflow, or scenario. It corresponds to the work that a number of collaborating
    business members perform in their roles defined in the object model, and not to any particular business member or any
    role that the member is playing.
</p>
<p>
    A business use case is what you normally work with to make the use-case model understandable, and to avoid drowning in
    details. It represents the union of a number of business use-case instances with workflows that are similar, but
    normally not identical.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, an employee who is competent to act in a certain role will do this in instances of several different
    business use cases.
</p>
<h5>
    Example:
</h5>
<p class="example">
    At the airport check-in counter, the two business use cases, Individual Check-in and Group Check-in both require the
    same competencies from the employee at the check-in counter, as well as access to the same information about a certain
    departure. Thus, both use cases can and should be designed using the same Check-in Agent business worker and Departure
    entity.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="XE_business_use_case__extent_of" name="XE_business_use_case__extent_of"></a><a id="Extent of a Business Use Case" name="Extent of a Business Use Case">Extent of a Business Use Case</a>
</h3>
<p>
    It is sometimes hard to decide if a service is one, or several business use cases. Apply the definition of a business
    use case to the airport check-in process. A passenger hands his ticket and baggage to the check-in agent, who finds a
    seat for the passenger, prints a boarding pass and starts baggage-handling. If the passenger has normal baggage, the
    check-in agent prints baggage tag and customer claim check, and terminates the business use case by applying the tag to
    the baggage, and giving the customer claim check, together with the boarding pass, to the passenger. If the baggage has
    a special shape or special contents so that it cannot be transported normally, the passenger must take it to a special
    baggage counter. If the baggage is heavy, the passenger must continue on to the airport ticket office to pay for it,
    because check-in agents do not handle money.
</p>
<p>
    Do you need one business use case at the check-in counter, another at the special baggage counter and a third at the
    ticket office? Or do you need just a single business use case? Surely, this transaction involves three different types
    of actions. But the question is, will any of them be of value to a passenger carrying special baggage if he does not do
    the others? No, it is only the complete procedure-from the moment the passenger approaches the check-in counter until
    he has paid the extra charge-that has value (and that makes sense to the passenger). Thus, the complete procedure
    involving the three different counters is a complete case of usage-a business use case.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to this criteria, it is practical to keep descriptions of closely related services together, so that you
    can review them at the same time, modify them together, test them together, write manuals for them, and in general
    manage them as a unit.
</p>
<p>
    Notice also that two independent business use cases can have similar beginnings.
</p>
<h5>
    Example:
</h5>
<p class="example">
    In an insurance company, the business use cases Handle Claim and Handle Request both start when someone (an actor)
    makes contact with a claim handler. The claim handler and the actor exchange some information to make it clear whether
    the actor is filing a claim or requesting some information. Then, and only then, is it possible to decide which
    business use case is performing. Although the two business use cases have similar beginnings, they are not connected.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Name" name="Name">Name</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The name of the business use case should express what happens when an instance of the business use case is performed.
    The form of the name should therefore be active, typically described by the gerund form of the verb (Checking-in) or a
    verb and a noun together.
</p>
<p>
    The names can either describe the tasks in the business use case from an external or an internal viewpoint, for
    instance placing an order or receiving an order. Although a business use case describes what happens within the
    business, it is often most natural to name the business use case from its primary actor's point of view. Once you have
    made a decision which style is to prefer in your case, you should follow the same rule for all business use cases in
    the business model.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Goals" name="Goals">Goals</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The goal of a business use case should be specified from at least two perspectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For the business actors the business process interacts with, specify the value those business actors expect from
        the business (external goals).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        From the perspective of the organization performing the business processes, define what the objectives are of
        having this business process in place and what you hope to achieve by performing it (internal goals).&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Performance Goals" name="Performance Goals">Performance Goals</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Some common metrics categories are:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Time - an approximation of the time it should take to execute the workflow, or part of the workflow.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Cost - an approximation of the cost of executing the workflow, or part of the workflow.
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality - for example, "no more than 2% of products should be defective when they come off the production line".
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A major challenge is to understand what scenarios (business use-case instances) are relevant to measure. Criteria to
    use are frequency of the scenario, or business relevance of the scenario. If you can determine that a particular part
    of the workflow has importance, you may save yourself some effort by only measuring the cost or time of that
    subflow.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Workflow - Structure" name="Workflow - Structure">Workflow - Structure</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Most workflows may be thought of as several subflows, which together yield the total flow. Sometimes several business
    use cases in the business have a common subflow, or the same subflow appears in different parts of one business use
    case. If this common behavior has any substantial volume, it should be performed by the same business workers.
</p>
<p>
    If a subflow is substantial, common to several business use cases, and also forms an independent and naturally
    delimited part, the model might be clearer if this behavior is partitioned out to a separate business use case. This
    new business use case is then either included in the original use case (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/include-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_F3DC3A5B.html" guid="8.096716256124967E-305">Guideline: Include-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model</a>), an extension to it
    (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/extend-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_17CD0314.html" guid="3.452362968952187E-305">Guideline: Extend-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model</a>), or a parent use case
    to it (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/use-case-generalization_in_the_business_use-case_model_7244BA6B.html" guid="1.7507761609726586E-307">Guideline: Use-Case-Generalization in the Business Use-Case Model</a>).
</p>
<h5>
    Example:
</h5>
<p class="example">
    At the airport check-in counter, the two business use cases, Individual Check-in and Group Check-in both use the same
    procedure to handle an individual passenger's baggage. Because the subflow is independent of the ticket handling, and
    is logically connected, it is modeled separately in the business use case, Baggage Handling.
</p>
<p>
    The workflow of a business use case can be visualized using activity diagrams, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/activity_diagram_in_the_business_use-case_model_5862EB50.html" guid="1.4038197112599951E-306">Guideline: Activity Diagram in the Business Use-Case Model</a>.

    of Use, you find an example of an activity diagram visualizing the structure of this workflow:
</p>
<p>
    <b>1. Basic Workflow</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.1. Initial Contact</b>
</p>
<p>
    This process starts with an initial contact between the Customer and The Company. This may happen in one of the
    following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Customer contacts The Company with an inquiry or a set of requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        The Company decides that it has products that would add value to the Customer and revenue to The Company.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Company interacts with the Customer to establish:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customer contact person,
    </li>
    <li>
        The Company contact person,
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether this is a new customer to The Company,
    </li>
    <li>
        Any competitive information about the proposal or bidding situation surrounding this agreement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>1.2. Initial Opportunity Work</b>
</p>
<p>
    There are two main purposes of this section:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Gather customer requirements,
    </li>
    <li>
        Decide about further actions on this opportunity.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The steps, Gather Preliminary customer requirements, Create sales plan (optional), and Perform Opportunity Analysis can
    be performed in an iterative manner, and may be performed somewhat in parallel.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.2.1 Gather Preliminary Customer Requirements</b>
</p>
<p>
    Gather both product requirements and customer business requirements by doing the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ask the Customer
    </li>
    <li>
        look at whatever customer input there is
    </li>
    <li>
        perform a preliminary site survey (optional)
    </li>
    <li>
        look at any available customer information
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A complete set of requirements would include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        choice of technology (could be several, if the customers wants alternatives investigated)
    </li>
    <li>
        any product preferences
    </li>
    <li>
        functional requirements (market analysis)
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>
            building structure and environmental characteristics
        </li>
        <li>
            demography
        </li>
        <li>
            mobility/capacity
        </li>
        <li>
            network growth projection
        </li>
        <li>
            installed base information
        </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        timelines
    </li>
    <li>
        service requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        price requirements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>1.2.2 Create Sales Plan (optional)</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Company works with the Customer to determine how it is going to propose a solution meeting the customer
    requirements. This creation is called a sales plan, and includes the network and switch characteristics for the
    potential solution. The strategic positioning of The Company and its network is also discussed so that we can prepare
    for future needs.<br />
     This sales plan is then reviewed with the Customer for accuracy and completeness. It will then be used throughout the
    proposal process as a guide when deciding which products, market packages, and line items to propose, and which
    assumptions to make when putting together the proposal.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.2.3 Perform Opportunity Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Company will obtain the high-level price and cost of the potential solution. This is done in order to understand
    the potential value of this opportunity, not to provide an accurate dollar amount to a Customer.<br />
     The Company then looks at the customer requirements to determine:

    <li>
        risks in the opportunity (product availability, competition, customer risk)
    </li>
    <li>
        costs compared to revenue
    </li>
    <li>
        type of opportunity (simple, complex, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        probability of sales

    <li>
        anticipated number for size of sales
    </li>

</p>
<p>
    <b>1.3. Create Proposal Project Plan</b>

    <b>1.5. Prepare a Quote</b>
</p>
<p>
    This flow is defined in detail in the business use case Quote Process, which is included.<br />

        Its name and brief description are clear and easy to understand, even to people outside the business modeling team.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each business use case is complete from an outside (actor's) perspective. For example, the business use case Handle
        Claim in an insurance company starts when a customer files a claim. The Handle Claim business use case is not
        complete unless it includes a notification about the decision from the insurance company to the customer and (if
        appropriate) a compensatory payment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each business use case normally is involved with at least one actor. Business use cases are initiated by actors,
        interact with actors to perform the tasks, and deliver results.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is possible, but unusual, for a supporting use case not to interact with an actor*. This is true if a business
        use case is initiated by an internal event and does not have to interact with an actor to perform its tasks.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    *This may seem counter to the UML definition of use case, but see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html" guid="3.9905535055726305E-306">Guideline: Business Use-Case Model</a>, section describing 'Internal Business Use

        It must be clear and easy to understand, even for people outside the business modeling team.
    </li>
    <li>
        It describes the workflow, not just the purpose of the business use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        It describes only those tasks that are inside the business.
    </li>
    <li>
        It describes all possible tasks in the business use case. For example, what happens if a condition is met, as well
        as what happens if it is not.
    </li>
    <li>
        It does not mention actors who do not communicate with it. If it did mention other actors, it would make the
        description difficult to understand and maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
        It describes only those tasks that belong to it, not what is going on in other business use cases that work
        parallel to it.
    </li>
    <li>
        It does not mention other business use cases with which it does not have relationships. If the business use case
        requires that some results exist in the business before it can start, this should be described as a precondition.
        The precondition should not have any references to the business use cases in which the result was created.
    </li>
    <li>
        It indicates if the order of any tasks described for the business use case is not fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is structured so that it is easy to read and understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        The description clearly describes the start and end of the workflow.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each extend-relationship is described clearly so that it is obvious how and when to insert the business use case.

<ul>
    <li>
        It is substantial. Remember, a concrete business use case must be easy to read, together with its abstract business
        use cases. Therefore, an abstract business use case should not be too small. If an abstract business use case is
        not substantial, it should be eliminated and its tasks should be described in the affected concrete business use
        cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        It contains logically related tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        It exists for a specific reason. An abstract business use case should contain any of three kinds of tasks: those
        that are common across several business use cases; those that are optional; or those that are important enough that
        you want to emphasize them in the model.
