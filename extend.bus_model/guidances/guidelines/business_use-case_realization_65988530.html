</h3>
<p>
    A business use-case model describes a business in terms of business actors and business use cases, corresponding, for
    example,&nbsp;to customers and business processes. The business use-case model includes workflow descriptions that
    identify <b>what</b> is done. <b>How</b> the work is performed in each business use case is described in the business
    analysis model, and, in particular, in business use-case realizations.
</p>
<p>
    The set of&nbsp;business systems and business workers which perform&nbsp;the work of a business use case, together with
    the business&nbsp;entities they access and manipulate as part of the process, and a description of the interaction, is
    called the business use-case realization. Instances of the same class (of business system, business worker or business
    entity) can participate in several different business use-case realizations, reflecting that the same kind of resource
    from time to time&nbsp;participates in different processes.
</p>
<p>
    The business systems form a containment hierarchy for the business workers and business entities (and conceivably other
    business systems), so you might expect that interactions by business systems would only occur only with other business
    systems. In fact you are not prohibited from showing interactions between business systems and business workers, for
    example, when you want to drill down inside a particular business system and expose its business workers and their
    interactions with each other and external business systems, when realizing a business use case. However, if you decide
    that a business system should&nbsp;present a well-defined boundary and interfaces in the business, you would not expose
    its contents in this way when realizing a business use case. Rather, you would derive <em>subordinate</em> business use
    cases for that business system (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/modeling_large_organizations_DB7556B6.html" guid="1.268342166757605E-304">Concept: Modeling Large Organizations</a>) and describe, at a&nbsp;subordinate level, how
    these are realized by collaborations of the internal resources of the business system.

    <a id="Using Activity Diagrams" name="Using Activity Diagrams">Using Activity Diagrams</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The first choice to document the realization of a business use case is to draw an activity diagram, where swimlanes (or
    partitions) represent the participating business systems or business workers. For each business use-case realization,
    there may be one or more activity diagrams to illustrate the workflow. A common way to organize is to have one overview
    diagram without swimlanes that cover the whole workflow, and where you show activities that are at a high level. Then,
    for each such activity there is a more detailed activity diagram that shows the swimlanes and the tasks at the business
    worker level. For readability reasons, a goal should be that each diagram fit on a page.

<h3>
    <a id="Using Communication and Sequence Diagrams" name="Using Communication and Sequence Diagrams">Using Communication
    and Sequence Diagrams</a>
</h3>
<p>
    For each business use-case realization there can be one or more interaction diagrams depicting its participating
    business systems, business workers and business entities, and their interactions. There are two types of interaction
    diagrams: Sequence diagrams and communication diagrams. They express similar information, but show it in different
    ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Sequence diagrams (as their name implies) show an explicit sequence of events and are better than activity diagrams
        for more complex scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
        Communication diagrams show the communication links and messages between objects and are better for understanding
        all of the effects on a given object.
    </li>
    <li>
        If alternative flows are few, but there are many business entities involved, interaction diagrams are often a
        better choice than the activity diagram to show the realization of the workflow.
    </li>
</ul>

    <a id="Using Class Diagrams" name="Using Class Diagrams">Using Class Diagrams</a>
</h3>
<p>
    For each business use-case realization there may be one or more component diagrams or class diagrams depicting its
    participating business systems, business workers and business entities. A diagram of this kind can be a useful help
    when coordinating all the requirements on a business system, business worker or business entity that participates in
    several business use-case realizations. See <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/diagrams_in_the_business_analysis_model_F0F7B759.html" guid="2.967860873569252E-305">Technique: Class Diagram in the Business Analysis Model</a>.

    <a id="How to Map Use-Case Relationships" name="How to Map Use-Case Relationships">How to Map Use-Case
    Relationships</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Relationships between business use cases correspond to relationships in the business analysis model. By studying what
    happens in the business, you can understand how to map the business use-case relationships to links between objects of
    the business use-case realizations. For more on use-case relationships, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html" guid="3.9905535055726305E-306">Guideline: Business Use-Case Model</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose a business use case (base) includes another business use case (inclusion). At a given moment, the employees
    will need to cease following the instructions of the base and switch to following the instructions of the inclusion as
    described in the documentation of the respective business use-case realizations. The following happens:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An identifiable state is reached in the execution of a process according to the base use case-a business worker has
        finished a certain task for example.
    </li>
    <li>
        A change in state is noticed by someone who is ready to start working according to the realization of the
        inclusion. Either the person sees some phenomenon, or is informed by someone in the inclusion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A business worker in the realization of the base interacts with the business workers in the realization of the
    inclusion to inform them of what is going on. The most natural modeling approach is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A realization of the inclusion has one object for each base it is included by. The objects originating from the
        base each have a link to the business worker individual that starts the work in the inclusion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
    <img height="160" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/bucr1.gif" width="455" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Each business worker in the realization of the base business use cases needs a link to the business worker that starts
    the work according the inclusion business use case.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A realization of the base business use case does not have objects representing the inclusion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the case of a business use case being extended by an another business use case, you will end up with a similar
    solution. In the realization of the extension, you will have one object representing the base, that has a link to an
    object initiating the work described within the extension.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="167" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/bucr2.gif" width="328" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Each business worker in the base business use cases needs a link to the business worker that starts the extension.
</p>
<p>
    For use-case-generalization, the solution is again similar. In the realization of the parent use case, you will see an
    object representing the child.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="177" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/bucr3.gif" width="439" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    There are business workers representing the child use cases in the realization of the parent.
</p>
<p>
    The use-case relationships have different interpretations. When it comes to their representations in the business
    analysis model, the difference is found in why the work defined in the inclusion, the extension or the parent business
    use case is initiated and how the business worker interprets the information. How the objects in the business use-case
    realizations interact follow the same structure in all cases.
