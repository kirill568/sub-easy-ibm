    <a id="Introduction" name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Business systems represent an independent capability within a business. They are used to partition and understand the
    structure of a business into manageable chunks, in much the same way that an organization is typically partitioned into
    interdependent units. However, the role and purpose of different parts of an organization are not always clear to other
    parts of it, which results in less-than-optimal interactions when executing a business process.
</p>
<p>
    Business systems take the concept of partitioning and interdependence one step further. Business systems not only bind
    and contain roles and resources (and possibly other business systems), but they also explicitly define
    <i>interfaces</i>, or the set of services or responsibilities they can be asked to provide. Organizations that define
    <i>service level agreements</i> to formally specify and manage interactions between departments and external
    collaborators are in effect defining business systems. The use of a business system often goes hand-in-hand with using
    business models at different levels of abstraction (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/modeling_large_organizations_DB7556B6.html" guid="1.268342166757605E-304">Concept: Modeling Large Organizations</a>).
</p>
<p>
    The term "business system" should not be confused with a software system. A business system contains people, hardware,
    and software and is therefore at a higher level of abstraction than a software system.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Business Systems Enable Dynamic Structure" name="Business Systems Enable Dynamic Structure"></a>Business Systems
    Enable Dynamic Structure
</h3>
<p>
    In his book <i>Enterprise Modeling with UML</i>, Chris Marshall points out that traditional relatively static
    organizational structures are no longer sufficient for the radically decentralized and dynamic business world that is
    emerging. We can no longer expect a part of the organization to remain intact for long periods of time. As he states in
    his book, "Value is created and delivered through value chains that form and disband over time. Indeed, the day when
    such a chain is formed for a single transaction may not be far away."
</p>
<p>
    Organizations are organic. As they feel increasing pressure from the business environment, they need to adapt to remain
    competitive. Taken to the extreme, a static organization structure may be crippling in a highly dynamic and ruthless
    business environment, and companies may need to turn to <b>dynamic structure</b> as a survival mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    In the traditional static organization structure, departmental boundaries are only conceptual. While this may be a sign
    of an "open" and "informal" organization, the result is that every person in and segment of the organization is
    intertwined with the rest of the organization. It becomes extremely difficult to change or manage one part of the
    organization completely independently from the other parts. Business systems enforce partitions and boundaries by
    disallowing interactions between business systems, except by the predefined interfaces. These interfaces (possibly
    formalized service-level agreements) become the hinges that support the organization. The most significant advantage to
    these interfaces between business systems is that different parts of the organization are decoupled from each other.
    Dependencies are defined in terms of responsibilities and not on <i>how</i> those responsibilities are carried out.
</p>
<p>
    Separating the specification of responsibilities from the realization of responsibilities, and&nbsp;binding users of
    the business system to services specified at its boundary, rather than&nbsp;binding to realizing elements inside the
    business system boundary,&nbsp;results in a nimble organization-one that is capable of changing its structure rapidly
    without degrading the performance of its processes. In such an organization, one of its capabilities (defined by a
    business system) can be modified, improved, or outsourced, and the overall effect on the rest of the organization is
    kept to a minimum. As long as the quality of service remains the same after the change, the business operations
    continue uninterrupted. The same work could be performed by a software system, one person, or an entire
    department-either on-site or remote.
</p>
<p>
    Using business events to abstract interactions could reduce direct dependencies between business systems even further.
    Because business events make time and space transparent, business systems can interact indirectly (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_event_213B3FAC.html" guid="1.3382783818773036E-305">Guideline: Business Event</a>).
</p>
<h4>
    Note: UML Modeling Guidance for Encapsulation
</h4>
<p>
    When modeling a business system with UML, we indicated in the description in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_system_BB28EEB.html" guid="{4064F184-314B-4965-9F08-6AE5DBF6205A}">Work Product: Business System</a>&nbsp;that if encapsulation was not
    considered important, then the business system boundary was notional - as in the traditional static organization
    structure discussed above - and, for interaction purposes at least - the business system did not exist during business
    operation. You can indicate this in UML by saying that the business system (which is a kind of UML component) is not
    <em>directly</em> instantiable - it comes into being only through the instantiation of its parts. In the next section,
    we discuss the provision of services by business systems: in this case we <em>are</em> concerned with encapsulation,
    and can indicate that the business system has more than a notional boundary by making it directly instantiable.
    This&nbsp;verifies the business system at analysis and design time in anticipation that, in operation, the boundary
    will be somehow made real.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Business Systems Have Well-defined Responsibilities" name="Business Systems Have Well-defined Responsibilities"></a>Business Systems Have Well-Defined Responsibilities
</h3>
<p>
    Business systems explicitly define the responsibilities (also called services) that they can be asked to perform. This
    specification of behavior is essential because it allows the decoupling of dependencies mentioned in the previous
    section. A business system that does not define its services is without meaning. There is no way that another business
    system can know what services it provides, other than inferring them from its name. For example, we could expect a
    Resourcing business system (in departmental terms, it would be called Resource Management) to provide services for
    requesting a resource, querying the availability of resources, and possibly querying the resources types, or profiles.
</p>
<p>
    Responsibilities (or services) define the means of interaction with the business system and are specified as operations
    of the interface(s) to it. These interfaces are collections of related services and as such describe the role that the
    business system can play in a particular interaction. In the example that appears below the next paragraph, we see that
    each interface is a collection of logically related services. These interfaces (clusters of responsibility) are
    assigned to the business system responsible for carrying out the responsibilities. When something external to the
    business system requests one of the provided services, an event occurs within the business system to initiate
    fulfillment of the requested service. This event, which is internal to the business system, may be explicitly defined
    as a business event. The roles and resources (business workers and business entities) within the business system then
    collaborate with each other (internally) to fulfill the requested service. As we can see, this is much the same way the
    business operates toward its customers. In fact, we could even model the business system as a "business," in which case
    the requestors of services would be the business system's business actors.
</p>
<p>
    The example below shows the business systems of a generic financial services institution. Only some of the dependencies
    between business systems and interfaces are shown to improve understandability. From this diagram, it becomes apparent
    that the responsibilities can be reassigned by allocating an interface to another business system. This reallocation of
    responsibility would conceptually have no effect on the business systems that make use of those services.
</p>

</p>
<h4>
    Note: UML Modeling Guidance for Services
</h4>
<p>
    We noted above that modeling a business system as a directly instantiable component&nbsp;is a strong indicator that the
    business system boundary&nbsp;is not intended to be&nbsp;just conceptual. We can continue this theme by modeling the
    responsibilities of the business systems by an analogous application of the <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/419_soa/">UML 2.0 Profile for Software Services</a>.
    Although directed at software services, the fundamental ideas in this profile apply equally well to business systems.
    The use of UML 2.0 ports to model services further verifies the business system boundary by defining clear
    <em>interaction points,</em> with well-defined interfaces, between users and business systems. These interaction points
    completely insulate the <em>implementation</em> of the business system's responsibilities from their <em>delivery</em>
    to consumers outside the business system. This method also&nbsp;gives the Business-Process Analyst and then the
    Business Designer&nbsp;a way of flexibly modeling the composition and choreography of services (to deliver value-added
    services at the business system boundary).
</p>
<h3>
    Business Systems Contain Roles and Resources
</h3>
<p>
    A business system is an abstraction of a collection of people, hardware, and software that work together to perform the
    responsibilities of the business system. We use the word "abstraction" because we do not describe the internal
    collaborations within the business system in terms of people, machines, and software, but in terms of roles and
    resources. A business system contains business workers and business entities. A business worker is a role that
    represents a <em>system</em> as we define it in the glossary. As far as the business modeling effort is concerned, it
    is a 'leaf' system, that is, it will be decomposed no further in the business modeling effort. We may decide during our
    business modeling study that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a human (or humans) may be bound to a particular business worker role, in which case we can stereotype it
        <em>&lt;&lt;worker&gt;&gt;</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        the role will be fulfilled by software (and associated computational hardware), in which case we can stereotype it
        <em>&lt;&lt;IT system&gt;&gt;</em>,
    </li>
    <li>
        the role has to be performed by a more complex system, which itself may&nbsp;use human, hardware and software
        resources - but which is not considered to be a <em>business</em> system for some reason. For example, in the
        airport example below, we may model the business system 'Flights' to contain business workers that transport
        passengers, that is, aircraft. Aircraft are complex systems in their own right, but decomposing them, their
        behavior and design, requires a significant paradigm shift from business thinking. So in this context, we can leave
        them as abstractions (although we will certainly be interested in specifying some of their characteristics - load
        carrying capability, range, and fuel consumption, among others) and stereotype them
        <em>&lt;&lt;system&gt;&gt;.</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A business entity is a piece of information created or manipulated by business workers. These business workers can
    eventually be mapped to human resources, or to specific hardware or software systems. This abstraction helps us focus
    on the role and interfaces of the business worker and determine the <i>necessary</i> responsibilities without having to
    consider the (usually imperfect) real situation of a specific person or system.
</p>
<p>
    Note that some of the resources owned by a business system may be virtual - for example, a business system may share a
    large mainframe with other business systems, but as far as the business systems are concerned, they own a virtual
    machine. The mapping of virtual resources can be shown at the level that owns the real resource - in many cases this
    will be the enterprise level (the entire business).
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Business Use Cases Cut Across Business Systems" name="Business Use Cases Cut Across Business Systems"></a>Business Use Cases Cut Across Business Systems
</h3>
<p>
    Business use cases must not be simply&nbsp;<em>allocated</em> to a business system. Business use cases are the
    customer-facing processes that require the collaboration of a number of business systems, partners, and suppliers. This
    is referred to as the <i>value chain</i>. Business systems collaborate to perform business use cases, as shown in the
    figure below.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="325" alt="Diagram shows collaboration between a customer, a partner, a regulatory body, and a supplier."     src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/resources/bsys1.gif" width="602" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    There is one exception: When creating business models at different levels of abstraction (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/modeling_large_organizations_DB7556B6.html" guid="1.268342166757605E-304">Concept: Modeling Large Organizations</a>), business use cases can be allocated to a
    business system. For example, you may want to model the business as a whole as well as one of the business systems of
    that business. In this case, there would be a Business Use-Case Model for the entire business, in which the overall
    business use cases would cut across the business systems (as shown above). At a lower level, the services requested
    from a particular business system could be captured as business use cases in the business system's Business Use-Case
    Model. The guideline that states that business use cases should not be allocated to a business system should then
    actually read: "A business use case at a particular level should not be allocated in its entirety to only one business
    system at a lower level."
</p>
<p>
    This cross-functional nature of business use cases is one of the reasons for the interest in business modeling and
    re-engineering, as well as in analysis of the cost and performance of business processes (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/activity-based_costing_8C3CE.html" guid="2.7281590029486614E-305">Concept: Activity-Based Costing</a>). It is more valuable to understand how the cost of
    the entire business use case relates to the added value provided to the customer than to know how the annual budget of
    one of the departments relates to the overall corporate budget.

<p>
    The figure below shows the business systems for the furniture store used as an example in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_goal_CCCB68FF.html" guid="9.06687347922131E-306">Guideline: Business Goal</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html" guid="3.9905535055726305E-306">Guideline: Business Use-Case Model</a>. This store keeps large inventory in a warehouse
    attached to its showroom. This allows customers to browse through the products on display in the showroom and pick up
    the products they have purchased at the warehouse. Customers can arrange for delivery of large items.

    This business has been divided into three interdependent business systems. Each business system has a clear purpose and
    provides well-defined services (not visible in the diagram). Explicitly defining these interdependencies and
    interactions helps to optimize the business.
</p>
<h4>
    Airport
</h4>
<p>
    An airport provides services to airlines and to passengers and visitors on behalf of the airlines. Because an airport
    is a very large and complex business to model, it makes sense to divide it into a number of independent business
    systems. Each business system can then be modeled independently as a business in its own right, as shown below.
</p>

</p>
<p align="left">
    In the example above, we see that an airline would have to participate in the Passengers and Flights business systems.
    Air traffic would be regulated by Air Traffic Control, according to laws and regulations. Hangar Facilities would
    provide services to the ground crews of the airline. Both Passengers and Flights would use services provided by Baggage
    Handling for departures and arrivals, respectively. The entertainment business system could also be called Airport
    Facilities and would include such things as shops, waiting areas, parking, and transport.
