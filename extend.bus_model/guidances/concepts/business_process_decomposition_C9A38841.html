    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    A <em><strong>business process</strong></em> is <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'">a group of logically
    related (and typically sequenced) activities that use the resources of the organization to provide defined results in
    support of the organization's objectives -- delivering value in the form of product or service, often&nbsp;to an
    external party such as a customer or partner. The process, possibly decomposed into sub-processes, has associated
    organization, resource, and data models to capture all aspects of the process, including not only performing roles, but
    required/used resources, ownership of resources, accountability, definitions of items passed into and out of tasks, and
    so on.</span>
</p>
<p>
    This is a very concrete view of process, and so we adopt the view that business processes are <em>realizations</em> of
    the bounding business system's <em>business use cases</em>. Therefore we can apply the same taxonomy to them as we do
    to business use cases (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html" guid="3.9905535055726305E-306">Guideline: Business Use-Case Model</a>), that is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Core</strong>, for the external-facing business&nbsp;processes that provide the value chain
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Management</strong>, for the internal business use cases that coordinate the value chain
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Support</strong>, for the internal business use cases that support the value chain
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We also allow processes to be event-driven, that is, they are triggered by conditions (resulting in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_event_853992A0.html" guid="{EF5798CC-41AE-4137-B248-B308D465CF8A}">Artifact: Business Event</a>s) that arise in the conduct of business.
</p>
<h3>
    Process Level
</h3>
<p>
    In&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/modeling_large_organizations_DB7556B6.html" guid="1.268342166757605E-304">Concept: Modeling Large Organizations</a>&nbsp;(extract in quotes below), we describe a
    technique for accommodating the needs of executive management, as well as business process owners, by defining business
    use cases at two levels of detail:
</p>
<p>
    "One model, for the executives, would contain a set of high-level business use cases that showed the intent and purpose
    of the organization. The other model, for the process owners, would contain a detailed set of use cases that helped
    clarify how the organization needs to function internally. For each high-level business use case, you could define one,
    or several, detailed business use cases representing the same activities in the organization..."
</p>
<p>
    The figure below illustrates this refinement of use cases.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em><img height="570" alt="Illustration of Business Use-Case refinement" src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/./resources/large1.gif"     width="517" /></em>
</p>
<p>
    Note that the lower-level, more detailed use cases are still use cases for the <em>same business system</em> as the
    high-level use cases, that is they still represent a black-box view of the behavior of that business system. For each
    of these levels of use-case, there is a corresponding realization, which we can describe as a business process, it is
    possible therefore to regard this kind of analysis as <em>process decomposition</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Process decomposition analyzes business processes and sub-processes to a level of detail at which it is feasible and
    useful to construct an <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/diagrams_in_the_business_analysis_model_F0F7B759.html" guid="2.967860873569252E-305">activity diagram</a> for the sub-process. Input to process decomposition can come from
    <em><strong>Level 1</strong></em> business process models, perhaps&nbsp;written only as narratives, and associated with
    the corresponding <em>Level 1</em> business use cases by realization relationships. <em><strong>A Level 1 process is
    the high-level description of what a business system does, meeting the needs of executive management, as described
    above.</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    Process decomposition results in a set of documented <em><strong>Level 2</strong></em> processes captured in the <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_analysis_model_9449F63A.html" guid="{CF53445C-3351-46C6-810E-8251830029A7}">Business Analysis Model</a> as <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_use_case_realization_55CAF00D.html" guid="{47F095EB-E651-4A34-B75B-BACE38ED90C7}">Business Use-Case Realizations</a> -- at <em>Level 2</em> it is typically
    possible to construct an activity diagram for the process, so as a rule of thumb we have&nbsp;three levels of
    decomposition -- level 1 process, level 2 process and activity (composed of activity nodes). There are several ways to
    illustrate a business use-case realization -- we focus on activity diagrams (see&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/diagrams_in_the_business_analysis_model_F0F7B759.html" guid="2.967860873569252E-305">Guideline: Diagrams in the Business Analysis Model</a>)&nbsp;here because they have a
    form and semantics that will be familiar to most business analysts interested in business process modeling. Such models
    are especially useful in identifying inefficiencies in current processes, leading to identification of opportunities
    for automation and business transformation.

<h3>
    Business Process Decomposition in SOMA mapped to Use-Case Refinement.
</h3>
<p>
    IBM <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/services/us/bcs/html/bcs_index.html">Global Business Services</a> (GBS) <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/services/us/bcs/pdf/g510-5060-ibm-service-oriented-modeling-arch.pdf">Service-Oriented
    Modeling and Architecture</a> (SOMA) is an approach and set of techniques for SOA that bridge the gap between business
    and IT.
</p>
<p>
    In the figures below, we map the results of process decomposition as SOMA would&nbsp;show it, to the equivalent results
    in business modeling using business use-case refinement. We include this to show that the two approaches are really
    only using different terminology and representations for the same concepts, and yield the same result in the end -- a
    set of business process descriptions that can be used to bridge the gap to automation, for example, using IT systems,
    or services in a Service-Oriented Architecture&nbsp;(<a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/service-oriented_architecture_C8869AEF.html" guid="_yVEVKdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">SOA</a>) initiative.

</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    The figure above shows process decomposition into sub-processes and use cases in a notational form used in SOMA. The
    notion of a sub-process is a convenient construct used to denote further levels of refinement of a process, into its
    constituent parts (sub-processes), recursively.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Once we get to the point where we begin to look at user-system interactions, we stop and label the sub-process a
    leaf-level sub-process.&nbsp; A leaf-level sub-process is&nbsp;potentially a&nbsp;composite of system use cases, for
    example, a leaf-level sub-process of Process Order might have have use-cases of Get Customer Name, Get Customer Address
    and Get Order Items.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    The figure below shows the equivalent structure expressed using RUP business modeling notation.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" align="center">
    <em><img height="406" alt="Illustration of mapping of business use-case refinement" src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/./resources/uc_refinement.jpg"     width="666" /></em>
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    This structure shows the same three levels, with the leaf-level sub-processes being represented by action nodes in the
    activity diagram.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Note that what SOMA shows as use cases at the lowest level, are not <em>Business</em> Use Cases as we define them here:
    they are -- as are the corresponding activity nodes (action nodes) in the Business Use-Case Realizations -- the loci
    for possible interaction(s) with IT systems. SOMA's use cases are therefore closer to the use cases that arise in
    application development, as it is described in RUP (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/going_from_business_models_to_systems_3B55D8F4.html" guid="1.3212739617274792E-306">Guideline: Going from Business Models to Systems</a>).

    between organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> A process model should concretely identify "what"
    needs to take place, not "how" tasks are carried out, since that is an aspect of business process that can change over
    time, especially in response to changes in business environment or technology.
