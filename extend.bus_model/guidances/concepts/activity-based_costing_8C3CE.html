<p>
    <b>Activity-based costing (ABC)</b> is a methodology that measures the cost and performance of activities, resources,
    and cost objects. Resources are assigned to activities, then activities are assigned to cost objects based on their
    use. Activity-based costing recognizes the causal relationships of cost drivers to activities <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html#PLR99" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">[PLR99]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Activity-based costing is about:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Measuring business process performance, activity by activity.&nbsp;
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Estimating the cost of business process outputs based on the cost of the resources used in producing the
            product.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Identifying opportunities to improve process efficiency and effectiveness. Activity costs are used as the
            quantitative measurement. If activities have unusually high costs or it they don't add value, they become
            targets for re-engineering.&nbsp;
        </p>

    <a id="XE_activity-based_management" name="XE_activity-based_management"></a><b>Activity-based management (ABM)</b> is

</h3>
<p>
    To calculate the performance of a business process, you need to know what the workflow is and what type of resources
    are involved in performing the workflow. You need to have the following elements describing the workflow in place
    before you can start measuring:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A description of the business use case representing the business process <span         style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language: EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">-</span>see

    </li>
    <li>
        One or more activity diagrams describing the workflow <span         style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language: EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">-</span>see

    </li>

        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_realization_65988530.html" guid="1.0660567082472948E-304">Technique: Business Use-Case Realization</a>.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Basic Cost Drivers
</h5>
<p>
    For each activity state in an activity diagram, the basic cost drivers are:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Resources:</b> determine what business workers and business entities are participating, and how many instances
        of each. The allocation of a resource to a workflow implies a certain cost.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Cost rate:</b> each business worker or business entity instance may have a cost per time in use.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Duration:</b> an activity occurs for a certain time, therefore a resource can either be allocated for the
        duration of the activity, or for a fixed amount of time.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Overhead:</b> any fixed costs that the invocation of a workflow or an activity would incur.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Additionally, for a transition you may need to determine the <b>Guard Probability</b>, which is the probability for a
    transition to be traversed. This needs to be determined for alternative threads such as outgoing transitions from a
    decision, and for conditional threads such as a conditional transition outgoing from a synchronization bar.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Calculating the Cost of Performing a Workflow
</h5>
<p>
    A workflow is described with a collection of activity states. For each of those activity states, you must define what
    the cost drivers are, in order to calculate the total cost for performing the activity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/resources/abc4.gif" alt="Image described by content" width="252" height="121" border="0" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    The total cost of performing this activity is 'number of resources' * 'resource cost'&nbsp; * ' duration' + 'overhead
    cost'. Knowing that the cost rate for using a customer representative is 200 per hour, the total cost for this activity
    is then 1*200*0.5 + 100=200.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The total cost of performing the workflow is the sum of the cost for each activity, although there is often an overhead
    associated with initiating the workflow. For the whole workflow, it may be interesting to calculate the total duration
    or frequency.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/resources/abc5.gif" alt="Image described by content" width="347" height="299" border="0" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    The workflow depicted in this activity graph has an overhead cost that needs to be added to the cost of performing each
    activity.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Concurrent Threads
</h5>
<p>
    If concurrent threads exist in an activity diagram, the duration of the longest thread is the relevant duration for all
    threads. Concurrent threads are shown using synchronization bars.
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/resources/abc1.gif" alt="Image described by content" width="486" height="388" border="0" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    The total duration for these two concurrent threads is 8 minutes, which is the duration of the longest thread in this
    case.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Alternative Threads
</h5>
<p>
    If alternative threads exist in an activity diagram, the cost for the alternative threads are calculated as the sum of
    the cost for each alternative, weighted with the occurrence probability for each alternative.&nbsp;Alternative threads
    are shown using decision icons.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/resources/abc2.gif" alt="Image described by content" width="368" height="362" border="0" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    The total calculated cost for a thread with alternatives is the weighted cost of the alternative threads.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Conditional Threads
</h5>
<p>
    If a conditional thread exists, the cost for that thread is added to the cost for its parallel threads, weighted with
    the probability of it occurring.&nbsp;A conditional thread is indicated with a guard condition on a transition.
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/resources/abc3.gif" alt="Image described by content" width="481" height="295" border="0" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    If there is a conditional thread, its cost is first weighted with the probability of it occurring, and then added to
    the cost of its parallel threads.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Nested Activity Graphs
</h5>
<p>
    If an activity has a sub-graph, the cost of that activity is the cost of the activities in the sub-graph.
</p>

    <a id="Identifying Areas of Improvement" name="Identifying Areas of Improvement">Identifying Areas of Improvement</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Activity-based costing is often used to compare alternatives, such as proposed change versus current practice, or to
    compare different proposed changes. There are three kinds of parameters to work with to explore differences between
    alternative flows:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Changing values of cost attributes without changing the structure or realization of the workflow; for example,
        assuming shorter time durations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changing structure of the workflow; for example, changing from sequential to concurrent execution of
        activities.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Changing what resources are used in the realization of the workflow; for example, merging resources to eliminate
        hand-offs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To compare these alternatives, you may create "sibling" activity diagrams to show the variations of the business use
    case. When changing what resources are used in the realization of the workflow, you must also establish "sibling"
    realizations of the workflows to correctly explore resource costs.&nbsp;
