<p>
    A business-modeling effort can have different scopes depending on context and need. Six such scenarios are listed
    below.
</p>
<h5>
    Scenario #1-Organization Chart
</h5>
<p>
    You may want to build a simple map of the organization and its processes to get a better understanding of what the
    requirements are on the application you are building. In this case, business modeling is part of the
    software-engineering project, primarily performed during the inception phase. These types of efforts often start out as
    merely charting with no intent of changing the organization, however, in reality, building and deploying a new
    application always includes some level of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_improvement_6638C494.html" guid="_x8yYBNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business improvement</a>.
</p>
<h5>
    Scenario #2-Domain Modeling
</h5>
<p>
    If you are building applications with the primary purpose of managing and presenting information, such as an order
    management system or a banking system, you may choose to build a model of that information at a business level, without
    considering the workflows of the business. This is referred to as domain modeling. Typically, domain modeling is part
    of the software-engineering project, and is performed during the inception and elaboration phases of the project.
</p>
<h5>
    Scenario #3-One Business Many Systems
</h5>
<p>
    If you are building a large system, or a family of applications, you may have one business-modeling effort that will
    serve as input to several software-engineering projects. The business models help you find functional requirements, and
    they serve as input to building the architecture of the application family. See <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/going_from_business_models_to_systems_3B55D8F4.html" guid="1.3212739617274792E-306">Guideline: Going from Business Models to Systems</a>. The business-modeling effort is,
    in this case, often treated as a project on its own.
</p>
<h5>
    Scenario #4-Generic Business Model
</h5>
<p>
    If you are building an application that will be used by several organizations-for example, a sales support application
    or a billing application <span     style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">-</span>it
    can be useful to go through a business-modeling effort to align the organizations as to how they do their business to
    avoid requirements that are too complex for the system (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_improvement_6638C494.html" guid="_x8yYBNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business improvement</a>). If aligning the organizations is not an option, however, a
    business-modeling effort can help you understand and manage differences in how the organizations will use the
    application and will make it easier to determine which application functionality should be prioritized.
</p>
<h5>
    Scenario #5-New Business
</h5>
<p>
    If an organization has decided to start a completely new line of business (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_creation_ABCA16F6.html" guid="_x8e2CdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business
    creation</a>), and will build information systems to support it, a business-modeling effort needs to be performed. In
    this case, the purpose of business modeling is not only to find requirements on systems, but also to determine the
    feasibility of the new line of business. The business-modeling effort is, in this case, often treated as a project on
    its own.
</p>
<h5>
    Scenario #6-Revamp
</h5>
<p>
    If an organization has decided to completely revamp their way of doing business (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_reengineering_8A1CC1F0.html" guid="_x87h-dnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business reengineering</a>), business modeling is often one or several projects in its
    own right. Typically, business reengineering is done in several stages: envision the new business, reverse-engineer the
    existing business, forward-engineer the new business, and install the new business.
