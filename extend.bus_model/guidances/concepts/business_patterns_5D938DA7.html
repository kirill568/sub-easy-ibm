    We define a business pattern as generalized solutions that can be implemented and applied in a problem situation (a
    context), and thereby eliminate one or more of the inherent problems. Patterns can be considered prototypes for
    production. [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html#ERI00" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">ERI00</a>]&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Patterns are part of how you define your business architecture:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        They reflect common solutions to common problems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Patterns help maintain an architectural style throughout the organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        They are a simple way of capturing experiences.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We present a few patterns that can be useful as a baseline:&nbsp;

    <b>Problem</b>: A process starts with an input and ends with an output. The process uses and consumes resources to
    create and refine other resources that become the output. A process also has a certain goal to achieve, which can be
    expressed in the number of resources that are output from the process. If resources are not used effectively, it may
    become too expensive to produce the outputs of the process, which would enable competitors to gain market shares.<span     style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>

    <b>Solution</b>: A solution to this problem is to measure the effectiveness of the process, and at each initiation of a

<h3>
    <a id="Business Event-Result History Pattern" name="Business Event-Result History Pattern">Business Event-Result
    History Pattern</a>
</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    <b>Context</b>: The business event-result history pattern is suitable for problem domains where you need to maintain a
    history of business events and their results. It is most often used to model financial systems and enterprise resource
    planning (ERP) systems.
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    <b>Problem</b>: The business event-result history pattern is use to track significant business events and then to
    connect these events to their results. Capturing the different business events, along with their results-such as
    decisions, contracts, statements, or products-helps you make better business decisions. The goal of this pattern is to
    enable you to keep a record of all important business events, which are typically described with attributes such as
    description, purpose, and result.
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    <b>Solution</b>: Using the business event-results history pattern ensures that models produced to track important
    business events and their causes are extensible. Extensible means that new kinds of events and causes can be added at a
    later date to the same overall structure. Using this pattern makes it possible to record business events and, at a
    later point in time, to analyze these events and draw conclusions. These conclusions typically lead to activities or
    decisions in the business, such as to discontinue a relationship with a customer or vendor because of poor payment
    history. If no record of business events is maintained, no history is available to learn from and the same mistakes may
    be repeated over and over again. One potential problem with this pattern is when too many low-level business events are
    recorded, the amount of detail makes the record hard to analyze and evaluate. Events should be defined so they're easy
    to understand in a business context; for example, order placed, product delivered, invoice paid, and so on.

    <b>List of participants:&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
    Business Event-This business entity describes significant occurrences to the business. Examples of attributes to a
    Business Event could be date, priority, description, and type. Common types are delivery, contract signing, and
    purchase.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Product-This business entity represents the deliverables. Products can be abstract objects, such as a service, business
    effort or market share or physical objects such as software and hardware. Common attributes are identifier and name.
    Common types of products are computer program, support, consultation, and installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Party-This business entity may represent either individuals or companies. The parties play a role in the context of a
    Contract. Typical roles are seller and buyer. Party typically has the attributes name and address.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Contract-This business entity represents a deal or a decision. The Contract defines the circumstances of a delivery,
    where the delivery is a Product. The Contract is usually between a seller and a buyer, but it can also be between other
    parties. Common attributes are description, date and until-date. Contracts can be associated with each other; for
    example, one contract can be complimentary to another contract. This is also shown with the recursive association.
    Examples of types of contracts are skeleton contract or lease contract.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Statement-A Statement expresses a Contract. A Statement can express many contracts and a contract can be stated many
    times. Typical attributes are description and date. Statements can also be associated with each other. This is shown
    with the recursive association. Examples of types of statements are written statements and verbal statements.
