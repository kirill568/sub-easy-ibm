    We define business architecture as an organized set of elements with clear relationships to one another, which together
    form a whole defined by its functionality. The elements represent the organizational and behavioral structure of a
    business system and show abstractions of the key processes and structures of the business [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">NDL97</a>], [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">ERI00</a>].

<p>
    Different people have different backgrounds and perspectives. When attempting to achieve a common understanding on
    something as complex as the organization-including its processes, structure, and strategy-we need a way to describe
    architecture and architecturally significant issues in a way that will be understood by each impacted group. This is
    done by describing three different-yet-related architectures as shown and described later in this document.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="334" alt="Image described by content" src="./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/resources/co_barc1.gif" width="683" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Business architecture</b> is a description of the significant aspects of the organization. <b>Application
    architecture</b> is a description of the software applications that support the business, including how those
    applications are used and how they interact with each other. <b>Technical architecture</b> is a description of the
    hardware infrastructure that supports the software applications.
</p>
<p>
    The business architecture must govern the application architecture, which in turn must govern the technical
    architecture. This does not imply a hierarchical relationship wherein the business architecture prescribes to the
    application architecture, and the application architecture prescribes to technical architecture. Rather, it means that
    goals and constraints (called drivers) are communicated in one direction, and any architectural decisions (called
    tradeoffs) that affect the governing architecture must be made at the level of the governing architecture. An
    architectural goal implies a desired condition, while an architectural constraint implies mandatory compliance.
    However, even constraints can be intentionally ignored. For example, a constraint that requires the business to comply
    with certain legislation might be ignored because the cost of making the changes necessary to comply far exceed the
    penalties incurred by noncompliance.
</p>
<p>
    Architecting is about balancing forces and making tradeoffs to create a solution that optimally satisfies conflicting
    requirements. This means that the business architecture defines goals and constraints that describe the support that it
    requires from application architecture. The same applies to the application and the technical architecture. Where
    conflicts arise, as they always do, localized sub-optimal solutions must be found in order to ensure an optimum overall
    solution. When these decisions have a broad impact, they are termed <b>architectural issues</b> and must be formally
    agreed to by stakeholders represented by an architecture board.
</p>
<p>
    These different architectures must always be considered when communicating with stakeholders. Discussing only one of
    them with an individual who does not understand its form, application, or notation results in ineffective
    communication. Furthermore, it can cause that individual to misunderstand the consequences of his or her decisions
    regarding the other architectures. The impact of decisions in one of the architectures must be translated to the other
    ones. This helps stakeholders understand the benefits and disadvantages of tradeoffs, which leads to architectural
    alignment. Architectural alignment helps us understand the consequences of decisions.
</p>

</h3>
<p>
    The business architecture is what we use to communicate with different stakeholders about the business to ensure a
    common, consistent understanding. We can describe the business architecture as the framework within which we make
    changes to the organization to enable the business to ultimately realize the business idea, as shown in the figure.

</h3>
<p>
    Because business architecture is complex and difficult to measure, we divide it into a number of different views. Much
    as the software architecture is defined in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_4269A354.html" guid="3.066252221588648E-305">Concept:
    Software Architecture</a>, the architectural views of the business will be defined here.
</p>
<p>
    Each view describes one aspect of the entire business. It therefore contains an architecturally significant subset of
    what would be a complete definition. In other words, an architectural view contains the 20% that really matters to that
    aspect of the business [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">ROY98</a>].
</p>
<p>
    The architectural views are helpful in discussing the business architecture with different stakeholders. Because each
    stakeholder has one or several views that are of particular interest, he or she can focus on those aspects of the
    organization that are associated with those views without having to understand everything else as well.
</p>
<p>
    Note that not all views apply to all situations. Some views can be ignored when they add no value, and sometimes it
    might be necessary to define new views. Here are some typical business architectural views:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Market View</b> describes the markets in which the business operates, customer profiles and offerings, or the
        products and services that the business offers to customers in the target markets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Business Process View</b> describes the significant goals of the business and outlines the key business use
        cases that support these goals.&nbsp;When business use cases are used to document business processes, this view is
        called the Business Use Case View.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Organization View</b> describes the groupings of roles and responsibilities within the business and the
        realization of business use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Human Resource View</b> describes remuneration profiles and incentive mechanisms, key cultural characteristics
        and mechanisms, competence profiles, and education and training mechanisms.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Domain View</b> describes the major business concepts and information structures used by the business.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Geographic View</b> describes the distribution of organizational structure, function and resources&nbsp;across
        physical locations such as cities and countries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Communication View</b> describes the communication pathways within the business.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Mapping of the Business Architectural Views to RUP Viewpoints&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    RUP Viewpoints are described in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/system_architecture_5F3B1E17.html" guid="_1om3AOM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA">Concept:
    System Architecture</a>. These viewpoints are applicable to system development generally. When the 'system' under
    consideration is a business, the Business Architectural Views form a more pertinent specialization of the generic
    viewpoints. The following table shows how they are related. Note that the Business Architectural Views, by the
    definitions offered in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/system_architecture_5F3B1E17.html" guid="_1om3AOM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA">Concept:
    System Architecture</a>, in some cases cover multiple views (where a view is the intersection of viewpoint and
    abstraction level).<br />

                    The market view defines, at least partially,&nbsp;the context for the business - it focuses on actual
                    and potential products and services offered to customers in the chosen markets. It maps to the
