    It is recommended that you initiate the assessment with a workshop where you gather the key stakeholders (known at that

    business-modeling effort, and to gather a comprehensive list of problems from stakeholders of the project.

    as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customers. Who are the customers? What requirements do customers have on the products, in terms of time-to-market,
        features, security, robustness and safety, and complexity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Competitors. Who are the competitors? In which areas are the competitors strong? What can be learned from
        competitors?
    </li>
    <li>
        Other stakeholders. Are their any other stakeholders involved? Are suppliers and partners involved? Are
        relationships with them a problem? Are there people with strong influence and opinions that need to be kept in the
        loop to avoid surprises?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Identify stakeholders within the target organization, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project managers
    </li>
    <li>
        Sales people
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer representatives
    </li>
    <li>
        Marketing people
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ask each stakeholder (representatives) what his or her expectations are on the target organization. This can be done
    either as part of and assessment workshop, or in the form of a questionnaire.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Interview people to understand their attitudes towards change. If people are negative or skeptic towards the change it
    is impossible to succeed with the change, unless you can turn the negative attitudes into positive.
</p>
<p>
    You must analyze and quantify your customers' present and future expectations. Do not make assumptions about customer
    expectations-get the information from the customers. You can either interview the customer, more or less formally, or
    you can use other market-research techniques, such as telemarketing.

        During the rest of the assessment to gather information.

    <li>
        As experts to help identify changes to the target organization.

        To contribute in a pilot project, then be mentor.

<p>
    Ask the stakeholders why they want to change their business processes and business tools. The following are some
    typical answers, and the effect they have on how you choose to explore and introduce the business processes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "We want to use this new technology and need to know how it affects our way of working."<br />
         An example could be a company that has decided to build an e-commerce web-site. The least controversial way of
        approaching this is in many cases to consider the changes as a new line of business, rather than a change of an
        existing set of business processes.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        "We need to make our business processes more effective to meet the competition."<br />
         In this case you need to ask some follow on questions to understand to what degree you need to become more
        efficient - are we talking about minor improvements, or about major rework and lots of new kinds of technology
        support. You also need to understand who those competitors are, and what kind of metrics is used to compare.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        "Our old legacy systems are breaking in the seams and we need to replace them before they burst." This also
        requires some follow-on questions to understand whether there is an expectation the business processes will change
        or not. If not, the approach is often to perform some high-level business modeling to get a map of the current
        organization, sometimes a domain model may suffice.&nbsp;

<tr valign="top">
<td><a id="Estimate the Capacity for Change" name="Estimate the Capacity for Change"></a>
<p>
    Analyze the capacity for change in the target organization. Organizations just like individuals can accommodate change
    but only within a limited range. Some organizations are better prepared for change than others are. To understand the
    organizational capacity for change we recommend that you interview the people in the organization, to understand the
    attitudes, and willingness to change.
</p>
<p>
    Factors to consider are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Whether there is a wariness of current conditions - the risk then is that any suggested change is perceived as
        being for the better and not properly questioned.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether there is a wariness of change - the organization may have gone through several reorganizations for various
        reasons that were not perceived as successful by the stakeholders. In this case any suggested changes need to be
        made rather concrete and be well motivated in order for people working in the organization to even consider whether
        they are of any value. It is also of value to explore why previous change efforts were not successful.
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the general attitudes among people working in the target organization. Are they "young and hungry" or
        "experienced and settled"?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether the target organization is an existing one, or whether it is something intended to be build from scratch.
        If the latter, you need to understand the intended capabilities of people in the new organization, and how much of
        ramp-up time it would be possible to give them.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In additions to the soft factors mentioned above, you should also assess the readiness for any new technologies, such
    as those needed to build an e-business solution. Examples of such technologies are [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html#CONA99" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">CONA99</a>]:

        <p align="left">
            Object communication protocols, such as OMG's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), the Java
            standard Remote Method Invocation (RMI), or Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).
        </p>
    </li>

    The best way to identify problems is to gather a number of key people for a problem-identification session. See <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/brainstorming_and_idea_reduction_73112962.html" guid="1.2379282201043798E-305">Guideline: Brainstorming and Idea Reduction</a>, for general advice on how to organize
    such a session.
</p>
<p>
    Ask questions such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What are the problems in the target organization?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there a perception that something is broken?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are projects routinely behind schedule or over budget?
    </li>
    <li>
        What problems do they have?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have any metrics been collected that can be analyzed?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Identify what <b>negative effects</b> each problem has, or will have, if it is not eliminated or reduced, for the
    projects. To know the effect of a problem helps you understand how critical it is to eliminate or reduce the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Identify <b>root causes</b> of each problem. To know the root causes of a problem helps you understand how to remove or
    reduce the problem, and how much it will cost. <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/fishbone_diagrams_AB0E2DBE.html" guid="1.0533204494757043E-304">Fishbone
    Diagrams</a> may be of help. If there are several root causes to a problem you need to weigh them against each other,

</p>
<p>
    Warning: It is very common to rush headlong into defining the solution, rather than taking time to first understand the
    problem. Write down the problem, and see if you can get everyone to agree on the definition.
</p>
<p>
    Rank the problems with respect to the effect they cause. For example, use a 1-to-5-scale, where 5 is for problems with
    the most dangerous effect, and 1 is for harmless problems. The primary purpose is to understand the relative importance
    of the problems.
</p>
<p>
    One of the simplest ways to gain agreement on the definition of the problem, is to write it down and see if everyone
    agrees. List the problems in a table:

    Analyze the results of the collected information and compile a list of areas and issues to focus on. Issues that should
    be addressed early usually fall into one or several of the following categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Major problem areas. Areas where you can improve the performance of the business processes a lot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Areas where you can make short-term profits. Areas where you can show fast results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Areas where an improvement will have high visibility.
    </li>
</ul>
