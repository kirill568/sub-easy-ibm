<p>
    Discuss the boundaries of what you choose to include in your modeling effort. Decide what constitutes the target
    organization. This can effectively (but not necessarily) be done using <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_actor_class_340D3EA2.html" guid="_x8e2ANnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business
    actor</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_use-case_class_8BABBBB1.html" guid="_x9FS9tnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">business use-case</a> notation, should the involved audience feel comfortable with such
    notation. It is important to gain agreement on answers to the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What important parties in the environment do you consider external to the target organization? This means
        identifying those parties whose work you cannot affect but with which you still need to have a well-defined
        interface.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are performing business modeling in order to define the requirements for a particular system, are there any
        parts of the organization that will <i>not</i> be affected by this system? Those parts can be considered external,
        since there is no point in using resources to produce descriptions of business processes that this project is not
        influenced by or cannot influence.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The boundaries that you set for the target organization may be rather different from those that you consider to be the
    boundaries of "the company."&nbsp;For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If your goal is to build a new sales support system, you might choose not to include anything that goes on in your
        product development department. Nonetheless, the product development department must be considered a business
        actor, since there are interfaces to it that need to be clarified. In this example, a party inside "the company" is
        considered external to the target organization and is therefore modeled as a business actor.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        If the system you are building is supposed to enhance communication with partners or vendors (a
        business-to-business application), you might choose to include those partners or vendors in your target
        organization. In this case, a party that is external to "the company" is inside your target organization. Note that
        this type of categorization is useful only if you have some insight into and influence on your partner's method of
        operation. If you can influence only the interfaces to the partner, it should be considered external and be modeled
        as a business actor.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        If the purpose of your project is to build a generic, customizable application (such as a commercial accounting
        application), the target organization must represent your assumptions about how the customers who buy the end
        product will use it. In this case, you are including an abstract party in the target organization.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul></td>

<p>
    In order to define the objectives of the business-modeling effort and manage stakeholders' expectations, clear
    objectives must be set and agreed upon by involved parties. This helps keep the business-modeling team focused and
    prevents divergent expectations.
</p>
<p>
    The objectives set here are not the same as the business goals that are identified later. These objectives apply
    specifically to what is to be achieved by the business-modeling effort. They are usually a combination of the following
    aspirations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reduce costs (operational and distribution). This is often a secondary objective, achieved by reducing lead time
        and improving quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce lead-time. Improve responsiveness, shorten development cycles, improve productivity, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Increase revenue.
    </li>
    <li>
        Increase the number of customers.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Reach new markets.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve the quality of both products and services.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve inventory and procurement management.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve channel relationship (partners and vendors).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Increase customer satisfaction expressed in both objective and subjective terms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your employees more effective in teaming and collaboration.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Merge businesses. When two businesses are combined into one, you might need to merge some of their business
        processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outsource part of the business.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To help clarify objectives, it is useful to ask the stakeholders the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If we say this is impossible, what would you do then?
    </li>
    <li>
        If we are successful, who will you tell about it?
    </li>
    <li>
        If we are unsuccessful, who will you <i>not</i> tell?
    </li>
    <li>
        What will happen if we are unsuccessful?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why do you think we are capable of solving this problem?
    </li>
    <li>
        How will you determine whether we have solved your problem?
    </li>

        When will you consider the job done?

        changing? Do the involved parties know the history of the problem?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Environmental:</b> Are there environmental or regulatory constraints or legal issues? Are there other standards
        that might restrict us?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Technical:</b> Are we restricted in our choice of technologies? Are we constrained to work within existing
        platforms or technologies? Are we prohibited from using any new ones?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Feasibility:</b> Is the schedule defined? Are we restricted to using existing resources? Can we use outside
        labor? Can we expand resources? If so, can we do so on a temporary or a permanent basis?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>System:</b> Is the solution to be built on our existing systems? Must we maintain compatibility with existing
        solutions? Which operating systems and environments must be supported?

<p>
    Most business-modeling efforts imply some change, and that change must be well motivated. You must formulate and
    document a problem statement in the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_vision_55FFBD95.html" guid="{C1A31211-2C05-4665-8DC5-6BFB63F4FCE4}">Business Vision</a>. This document, and the problem statement in
    particular, serve to convince stakeholders of the need for change and focus all involved parties on the issues that
    must be addressed.
</p>
<p>
    In your <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_target_organization_assessment_850E5BD3.html" guid="{1C96F563-092E-4584-A1C9-1A8CF58C7FA6}">Target-Organization Assessment</a>, you might have defined a list of
    problems that the stakeholders have determined exist in the target organization. In the Business Vision, you need to
    limit the list of problems to the ones you intend to focus on solving within the boundaries of your business-modeling
    effort. While it is very difficult to identify one single root cause for all the problems you have found, you must
    always attempt to do this. Formulating a problem statement helps determine whether the perceived problem is in fact the
    real problem.
</p>
<p>
    Working with the whole team, use easel charts to fill in the following template for each problem you have identified:
</p>
<p>
    <b>The problem of</b> (Describe the problem.)<br />
     <b>affects</b> (List the stakeholders affected by the problem.)<br />
     <b>the impact of which is</b> (Describe the impact of the problem.)<br />
     <b>A successful solution would</b> (List some key benefits of a successful solution.)
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this template is to help you distinguish solutions and answers from problems and questions. For example:
</p>
<p class="example">
    <b>The problem of</b> untimely and improper resolution of customer service issues<br />
     <b>affects</b> our customers, customer support reps, and service technicians<br />
     <b>the impact of which is</b> customer dissatisfaction, perceived lack of quality, unhappy employees, and loss of
    revenue.<b><br />
     A successful solution would</b> provide real-time access to a troubleshooting database by support reps and facilitate
    the timely dispatch of service technicians to only those locations that genuinely need their assistance.
