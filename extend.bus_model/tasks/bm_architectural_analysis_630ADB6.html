<td><p>
    The business architecture overview is created early in the lifecycle of a project, possibly as early as the development
    of the proposal. It is often depicted in graphical form, using some informal notation or storyboarding technique. It
    represents the intent and idea behind a business modeling effort. The lead business-process analyst produces the
    business architecture overview, often in collaboration with the project sponsor.
</p>
<p>
    The overview graph must indicate major elements of the business and its environment, such as teams, business tools, and
    external sources of influence (for example, regulatory bodies, partners, and market segments).&nbsp;The overview graph
    most often does not focus on the entire business architecture as described here. However, a large effort, such as a
    business process re-engineering (BPR) project, would consider the entire business architecture. The notion of business
    architecture is described in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/business_architecture_D437B035.html" guid="2.6275891002471178E-306">Concept:
    Business Architecture</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It is useful to consider the purpose of business architecture and its intended audience. This ensures that the manner
    in which the business architecture is described and presented will be appropriate for those who must understand it. The
    intended audience can be categorized into different groups with various concerns. Each of these groups will be
    interested in different architectural views of the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_architecture_document_A73E67D4.html" guid="{D3A0CA96-30AD-4461-9386-A3EC9A7E879F}">Work Product: Business Architecture Document</a>.

<p>
    At this point, the business architecture overview is a provisional first pass. No commitments should be based on this
    overview diagram. The initial overview graph may or may not be included as part of the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_architecture_document_A73E67D4.html" guid="{D3A0CA96-30AD-4461-9386-A3EC9A7E879F}">Work Product: Business Architecture Document</a>, depending on what value

<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    Identify the constraints and trends within the business and its environment that could have a significant effect on the
    structure of the business or the way in which it works. When defining the business architecture, these forces must be
    analyzed to ensure that the business can adapt to possible changes within a reasonable time and withstand other kinds
    of impact.&nbsp; Forces that are worth considering include the business strategy and trends, as well as possible future
    events that would affect every part of the organization or radically change some significant central part of it. In
    addition, it is important to consider changes that might have to be made very rapidly, along with constraints that
    might be imposed or lifted in future that may alter the way business is done or open new opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the probability of these events or changes occurring, and try to visualize their effects on the business. Once
    you understand the probabilities and effects, you can prioritize these forces and make decisions regarding how to deal
    with the highest-priority issues. The options available for dealing with each change are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prepare for rapid response to the change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Act is if the change has already occurred.

    <li>
        Minimize the possible effects of the change.

<div class="stepContent">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="stepTable">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    Identify and briefly describe business systems within the business being modeled. Business systems are really only
    useful for large, complex business models. Depending on the business-modeling scenario and the scope of your efforts,
    you might decide against using business systems at all.
</p>
<p>
    A business system represents a relatively independent capability within the organization. It defines a set of
    responsibilities as well as the business workers, business entities, and business events that undertake these
    responsibilities. In this way, a business system is a structural part of the organization, like a department, except
    that the only interactions allowed within a business system are through the predefined responsibilities. Consider, for
    example, a serving window in a restaurant or an IT support department with a services catalog. In both these examples,
    there are predefined interactions. What, for example, would happen if you went around to the back of the restaurant to
    try to get a meal from somebody in the kitchen? Similarly, what would happen if you asked the computer support
    technician to book you an airline flight? We use business systems to disallow any interactions with the business
    workers and business entities within it, other than the specified interactions. This allows us to partition large,
    complex business models so that we can focus on detailing one part of the model without losing sight of where it fits
    into the whole.
</p>
<p>
    Discuss and obtain agreement regarding which (if any) business systems should be included in your model. Some business
    systems may be described in only limited detail in the context of the business use-case realizations. Others may
    provide important input or receive output, in which cases they should be modeled as business actors. This means they
    are external to the business being modeled.
</p>
<p>
    You may want to indicate how a business system participates in a business use case without showing the internal
    interactions between business workers and business entities within that business system. Where necessary, you can "zoom
    into" the business system to show internal collaborations as part of the business use case.

    <li>
        Consider the competence profiles that exist within the organization. Define competence profiles that will be

        employees to be more or less independent? Will they need higher or lower education requirements?
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss education needs. Define both long-term training programs to overcome the differences between current and
        desired competence profiles, as well as any initial training needs associated with the introduction of new business
        processes.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Define any mechanisms (reward structures, trainee programs, mentor programs, or other incentives) that exist or
        need to be put in place to enhance skill levels. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore the possibility of relocating individuals in the organization due to changes in responsibilities or the
        need to enhance communication.

</ul>
<p>
    The process of describing cultural aspects of the business includes the following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine the characteristics of the culture.&nbsp;

    <li>
        Determine which of these characteristics are key to the organization and must be left undisturbed.&nbsp;

    <li>
        Discuss which characteristics must change.

    <li>
        Determine what mechanisms are in place to maintain and encourage the culture. Discuss ideas for new or changed
        mechanisms.

    <li>
        Define a path to be taken to introduce any changes that you deem necessary.&nbsp;
