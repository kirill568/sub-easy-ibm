    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Manual Tester supports four types of statements for writing a test script: steps, verification points,
    reporting points, and groups. The question often arises: What is the difference between a verification point (VP) and a
    reporting point (RP)? This tool mentor describes the difference, and provides some guidance on when to use verification
    points and when to use reporting points.
</p>
<h4>
    How are verification points and reporting points different?
</h4>
<p>
    <i>Verification points</i> are steps inside a script that are meant to provide the tester with a way of asking
    questions about the application under test. When a tester has followed a series of steps that change the appearance of
    the application, a VP can be used to indicate that the application responded correctly. In this way, if a VP fails, the
    tester knows immediately that one of the following is true:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The tester did not follow the steps correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application is not behaving correctly. In this case, the application could have changed since the time when the
        test was written. As a result, the test itself could be out-of-date, or the application could have a new defect in
        it.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, a VP could ask "Did the application open a new window?" after the tester clicked the <strong>File &gt; New
    Window</strong> menu option, or "Is the error message displayed in a red font?" after the test has deliberately created
    an error condition.
</p>
<p>
    When a tester runs a script, VPs allow the tester to communicate that the application behaved in one of the following
    ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        As expected (via the <i>pass</i> result)
    </li>
    <li>
        Not as expected (via <i>fail</i> when the result is clearly incorrect, or via <i>error</i> when something
        completely unexpected happens, like an unexpected error dialog popping up)
    </li>
    <li>
        Neither obviously as expected or not as expected (via the <i>inconclusive</i> result).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <i>Reporting points</i> are also steps in a script, but they are meant to allow the tester to report on the state of
    the test itself. Suppose a test is intended to prove that the tester can create a new order in an online ordering
    system. The tester may navigate the application correctly, following all the steps of the script and therefore giving
    all the VPs a <i>pass</i> result. However, when the tester goes to the order status screen, the order cannot be found.
    In this case, the tester could use the RP to indicate that the test failed, even though all the VPs passed.
</p>
<p>
    As with verification points, the tester would use the <i>pass</i> result if the test obviously achieved the overall
    objective. The tester would use the <i>fail</i> result if the test obviously did not achieve its objective. The
    <i>error</i> result would indicate that the test result was both wrong and unexpected, and the <i>inconclusive</i>
    result would indicate that the tester could not determine if the test passed or failed.
</p>
<p>
    Tests will typically have many VPs, and at least one but usually very few RPs.
</p>
<p>
    This tool mentor provides an example of how you can structure a test script to use VPs and RPs in an optimal way.
</p>
<h3>
    Tool Steps
</h3>
<p>
    To create a summary report of VPs in a test script using RPs, perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Create a series of steps to perform some task in the application being tested
    </li>
    <li>
        At the end of that series of steps, include a VP that asks if the application (or some portion of the application)
        now has a particular appearance
    </li>
    <li>
        If it would help the tester to run the test, include an image of your application in the VP
    </li>
    <li>
        If it helps with readability, put the steps and their VP in a group
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat the above four steps for each task in the test
    </li>
    <li>
        At the end of the test, include one RP that asks if some overall result has been achieved by performing all the
        steps in the test
    </li>
</ol></td>
